# Accessify

Accessify is a control interface for Spotify on Windows, designed to be accessible for screen reader users.  Until Spotify release an alternative to libspotify, it will use the standard Spotify Windows client for the actual playback of content.

## Features

### Search

High priority:

- Search for tracks, artists, albums and playlists.
- Play results continuously when one is selected for playback.
- Show the first 50 results by default, and fetch more as the user scrols down the list.

Medium priority:

- Cache results to speed up repeated searches.
- Store a history of previously-performed searches and autocomplete as the user types.
- Opt to display saved albums/tracks at the top of search results.

Low priority:

- Bookmark favourite searchs for quick access.
- Give weights to autocomplete suggestions based on previous search frequency.
- Browse previous search history.
- Specify advanced search criteria in a dialog instead of using Spotify search modifiers e.g. artist and year directly.

Other ideas:

- Show frequently/recently-played content first in results lists.
- Use croud-sourced data to provide search suggestions via an API.
